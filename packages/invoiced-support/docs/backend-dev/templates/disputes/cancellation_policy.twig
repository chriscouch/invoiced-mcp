    <h1>Invoiced Cancellation Policy</h1>
    <p>As an Invoiced subscriber, you are free to cancel your Invoiced subscription at any time. Canceling will prevent your subscription for the next billing cycle from renewing in accordance with the billing cycle you agreed to when signing up for Invoiced. For example, if you are billed monthly from us then you can cancel in the middle of the month to prevent being charged for the next month.</p>

    <p>We've made the cancellation process as easy as possible. However, all cancellations must be issued through our dashboard. Arbitrary emails requesting cancellation are not considered definitive since there is an instant method to cancel online.</p>

    <p>If you wish to cancel please follow these simple instructions:</p>

    <p>1. Log in to the web app at <a href="https://invoiced.com">invoiced.com.</a></p>
    <p>2. Go to the <strong>Settings </strong>section in the left sidebar of the app.</p>
    <p>3. Click on <strong>Billing</strong> in the <em>Business Settings</em> section.</p>
    <p>4. Underneath <strong>Your Plan</strong> click the red <strong>Cancel my account </strong>button.</p>
    <p>5. Confirm your password and click <strong>Cancel </strong>to immediately cancel your account.</p>
    <p>You will be signed out immediately. You may sign back in within 90 days to reactivate your account should you change your mind. Please message us at support@invoiced.com if you need your data exported.</p>
