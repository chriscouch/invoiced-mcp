            <spacer size="20"></spacer>
            <h5>What happens next?</h5>
            <p>1. <strong>Send invoices</strong> - Flywire Payments is already enabled as a payment option.</p>
            
            <p>2. <strong>Track transactions in real time</strong> - Open <strong>Settings &rarr; Payments &rarr; Account</strong> to see settlements, fees, and settlement ETA (usually <strong>T+2</strong> for card, <strong>T+5</strong> for ACH direct debit).</strong>
            
            <p>3. <strong>Relax on reconciliation</strong> - Every payment auto-syncs to your ledger, so your books stay spotless.</p>
