		<h3>How do I view my invoice(s)?</h3>
		<p>
			You can view an invoice when you receive an email from the customer portal by clicking the <strong>View Invoice</strong> button. This will jump you into the customer portal and take you to the correct invoice.

		<p>
			If you are signed in to the customer portal you can also click on any invoice # to be taken to that invoice.

		<h3>How do I pay my invoice(s)?</h3>
		<p>
			When viewing an invoice you can click the <strong>Pay Invoice</strong> button. If an invoice does not have a pay button then it is not eligible for payments. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a pending payment or if AutoPay is enabled.

			In the customer portal you can go to the My Account page in order to add your bank account or credit card in the <strong>Payment Method</strong> section.

		<p>
			Also, when paying invoices you can check a box on the payment form if you wish to save your payment method for use in the future.

		<h3>How do I sign up for AutoPay?</h3>
		<p>
			You can enroll in AutoPay by going to the <strong>My Account</strong> page and clicking on <strong>Enroll in AutoPay</strong>. You will then be asked to enter in your payment method. Please be aware that this option will only be available if we have enabled AutoPay for your account.
		</p>
		<p>
			When AutoPay is engaged then your payment method on file (card or bank account) will be charged automatically when there is a new invoice.
		</p>

		<a id="faq-9"></a>
		<h3>How do I access my historic invoices?</h3>
		<p>
			You can see all of your transactions on the <strong>Activity</strong> page, including invoices, estimates, credit notes, and payments. On the Activity page you can download document PDFs, select multiple invoices to pay, filter transactions by status and date range, and look up transactions by invoice #.
