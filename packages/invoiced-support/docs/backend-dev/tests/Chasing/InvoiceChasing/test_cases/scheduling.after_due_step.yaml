# Tests that "After due" step
# - Should not be scheduled if (invoice due date + days after) is in the past
# - Should be scheduled if (invoice due date + days after) is in the future
# - Should be canceled if updated, not sent and (invoice due date + days after) is in the past
#-  Should be uncanceled if updated (was in the past) and (invoice due date + days after) is in the future

    # PART 2: Test that a ScheduledSend is created after the invoice due date is updated to a future date
    # and the delivery is reprocessed.
    # NOTE: We update the invoice due date in this test rather than the step option because
    # updating the test option can only give us a static value since the date is
    # (invoice due date + days after option). Since we can set the due date to some time in the
    # future, we update it to prove our test case.
